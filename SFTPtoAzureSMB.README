Prerequisites
WinSCP .NET assembly (WinSCPnet.dll) must be available on the system.
Access to Azure SMB mapped or UNC path must be reachable internally (e.g., \\storageaccount.file.core.windows.net\share).
Service account credentials (not interactive logins).

Notes:
SshHostKeyPolicy = "GiveUpSecurityAndAcceptAny" is unsafe for production â€” replace with actual fingerprint validation for internal environments if needed.
If your environment uses Kerberos or domain-based access to Azure Files, you may skip SMB credential input and use the context of the running service account.
